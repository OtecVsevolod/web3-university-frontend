    "token_lesson1_paragraph1": "Imagine you have a <highlight>painting</highlight>, and you want to sell it not as a whole, but in parts — like 1% each. Everyone gets their “slice”, and if the painting gains value — their share does too. That’s <highlight>tokenization</highlight>.",
    "token_lesson1_paragraph2": "<highlight>Tokenization</highlight> is the process of turning any physical or digital asset into tokens. It’s like putting a digital QR code on a real object: now it can be bought, sold, divided, and tracked — directly through the blockchain.",
    "token_lesson1_paragraph3": "📦 Tokenization examples:\n— Real estate → token = 1 m²;\n— Car → token = 1/100 of the car;\n— Music album → token = 5% profit rights;\n— Even expert time → token = 1 hour of consulting.",
    "token_lesson1_paragraph4": "💡 Analogy: think of a regular company share. But instead of paper — it’s a token living on the blockchain. No notary, no bank, no lawyer — everything is automated.",
    "token_lesson1_paragraph5": "⛓️ Technology: tokens are most often issued on Ethereum or other blockchains using ERC-20 or ERC-721 standards. This lets them move freely between wallets, DEXs, and protocols.",
    "token_lesson1_paragraph6": "✅ Benefits of tokenization:\n— Investment access for regular people\n— Fractional ownership: you can buy part of something\n— Transparency: the whole history is on-chain\n— Automation: deals happen without middlemen",
    "token_lesson1_paragraph7": "⚠️ Risks and downsides:\n— Who guarantees that the token = real asset?\n— If the company disappears — the tokens are worthless\n— Legal jurisdiction and regulations\n— Possibility of centralized control",
    "token_lesson1_paragraph8": "🧠 Philosophy:\nOn one hand, tokenization gives access to things that only banks and funds had before.\nOn the other — it begins an era of total digital visibility. Everything you buy can be tracked, restricted, or frozen.",
    "token_lesson1_paragraph9": "It’s not “good” or “bad”. It’s a new stage.\n💥 Those who understand can use tokens as tools of freedom and power.\nThose who don’t — may end up in a new form of digital slavery.",
    "token_lesson1_paragraph10": "🧭 Conclusion:\n<highlight>Tokenization is both an opportunity and a threat.</highlight>\nIt opens doors — but you must understand who holds the keys.",
  
    "token_lesson2_title": "Lesson 2: What Are RWAs (Real World Assets)?",
    "token_lesson2_paragraph1": "Imagine you could buy a share of a house, a factory, or even a container of gold — not through a bank, but directly in your wallet. That’s what <highlight>RWAs</highlight> are — real assets tokenized and accessible in Web3.",
    "token_lesson2_paragraph2": "<highlight>RWA (Real World Assets)</highlight> are physical things (like real estate, gold, bonds, commodities) brought into the blockchain as tokens.",
    "token_lesson2_paragraph3": "📦 Examples:\n— House in Tbilisi → token = 1 m²;\n— 100 grams of gold → token = 1 gram;\n— Tesla stocks → tokenized copies via DeFi.",
    "token_lesson2_paragraph4": "💡 Analogy: in the past, only banks and funds could “hold” real assets. Now it’s like a digital vault on the blockchain — accessible to everyone.",
    "token_lesson2_paragraph5": "✅ Why tokenize real assets:\n— Liquidity (sell a part of an asset)\n— Easier access (no broker needed)\n— Global availability (24/7, no borders)\n— Transparent accounting (everything is on-chain)",
    "token_lesson2_paragraph6": "⚠️ But there are risks:\n— <highlight>The physical asset still exists in the real world</highlight> → meaning risk of seizure, fire, theft.\n— Who holds and verifies the asset? Can they be trusted?\n— Legal gray zones: token ≠ legal right without a law.",
    "token_lesson2_paragraph7": "🧠 Philosophy:\nOn one hand, it’s a revolution — anyone can own a share of something on another continent.\nOn the other — a fragile bridge between the old world and Web3, with little legal connection.",
    "token_lesson2_paragraph8": "Before, only corporations and banks held assets. Now anyone can be an investor.\nBut remember: if you trust a token for gold — you’re trusting a vault that might be on the other side of the planet.",
    "token_lesson2_paragraph9": "💥 Realization:\n<highlight>RWA is an attempt to digitize the physical world for the Web3 user.</highlight>\nBut for now, it runs on belief, trust, and legal promises.",
    "token_lesson2_paragraph10": "🧭 Conclusion:\n<highlight>RWA = opportunity + risk.</highlight>\nIt’s a bridge between reality and Web3. The question is — who holds that bridge: you, the community, or the old system?",
  
    "token_lesson3_title": "Lesson 3: How Real Assets Are Tokenized",
    "token_lesson3_paragraph1": "Let’s say you own an apartment. You want to sell only 25% of it — and not through a realtor, but through Web3. How do you do that? That’s practical <highlight>tokenization</highlight>.",
    "token_lesson3_paragraph2": "💡 Simple example:\n1. You register the asset on a special platform.\n2. The platform verifies documents (legal, KYC, valuation).\n3. The apartment gets “wrapped” into tokens. For example: 1000 tokens = the entire apartment.\n4. These tokens are sold to others.",
    "token_lesson3_paragraph3": "Now you hold 750 tokens. The remaining 250 can be bought by others. They become “fractional owners,” and you get funds or can buy them back later.",
    "token_lesson3_paragraph4": "🧠 <highlight>Philosophy</highlight>:\nThis sounds like freedom — issuing “digital shares” of your own property.\nBut here’s the catch: who confirms you really own the apartment? What if someone challenges it in court?",
    "token_lesson3_paragraph5": "✅ Benefits of tokenizing assets:\n— Raise funds fast without selling all your property\n— Investors get a share and benefit if the asset grows in value\n— Fully digital and 24/7 tradable",
    "token_lesson3_paragraph6": "⚠️ Risks and weaknesses:\n— Token ≠ full legal right (in most countries)\n— Regulators may classify tokens as securities\n— If the platform disappears — what happens to the tokens?\n— Many lawyers don’t even understand how this works",
    "token_lesson3_paragraph7": "🔍 Analogy:\nYour apartment is like a business. The tokens are like shares. But instead of IPO — you have a “TPO” — tokenized public offering.",
    "token_lesson3_paragraph8": "💥 Important:\n<highlight>Tokenization isn’t just technical — it’s a political and economic shift.</highlight>\nIt brings physical property into digital space, governed by code, protocols, and smart contracts.",
    "token_lesson3_paragraph9": "🧭 Conclusion:\nTokenizing assets is a tool.\nIn conscious hands — it’s power.\nIn corporate hands — it’s control.\n<highlight>The question is: who deploys the smart contract?</highlight>",
    "token_lesson4_title": "Lesson 4: Why Tokenize Everything?",
    "token_lesson4_paragraph1": "Why are governments, banks, and projects actively pushing tokenization of everything — from gold to debt? Because it’s a new form of control, governance, and profit.",
    "token_lesson4_paragraph2": "💼 Governments:\nThey want to see everything: who bought, how much, where the money came from. Tokenization provides transparency, accounting, control, and a tax base.",
    "token_lesson4_paragraph3": "💰 Business and startups:\nIt’s a quick way to raise funds. Instead of IPO — just tokenize a building, product, or factory. Less paperwork, more flexibility.",
    "token_lesson4_paragraph4": "👨‍💻 Web3 community:\nSome see tokenization as a path to decentralize capital: now anyone can own part of the world — not just elites.",
    "token_lesson4_paragraph5": "🧠 <highlight>Philosophy</highlight>:\nTokenization is the shift from “things” to “digital representations of things”.\nThe world is becoming virtual — not just in games, but in the economy. And that has a price.",
    "token_lesson4_paragraph6": "✅ Pros:\n— Easier access to investments\n— Fast and transparent transactions\n— Fractional ownership\n— Effective mechanisms for small capital",
    "token_lesson4_paragraph7": "⚠️ Cons and risks:\n— Loss of physical contact with the asset\n— Dependence on platforms, oracles, custodians\n— Centralization disguised as decentralization\n— Risk of “phantom assets” — where token ≠ reality",
    "token_lesson4_paragraph8": "💥 Paradox:\nThe more we digitize reality, the less we control it.\n<highlight>You own a real estate token… but who controls the signature behind the smart contract?</highlight>",
    "token_lesson4_paragraph9": "🔍 Who profits?\n— The one who launches the platform\n— The one who issues the tokens\n— The one who registers the assets\nAnd who loses? The one who doesn't realize they're just buying a “promise” in token form.",
    "token_lesson4_paragraph10": "🧭 Conclusion:\n<highlight>Tokenization isn’t just convenience.</highlight>\nIt’s a transformation of everything: property, law, rights, money.\nIf you want to stay free — understand that a token isn’t the thing, it’s a contract. And contracts have structure.",
  
    "token_lesson5_title": "Lesson 5: What is a CBDC?",
    "token_lesson5_paragraph1": "Imagine a cryptocurrency… but issued not by a DeFi platform, but your country’s central bank. That’s a <highlight>CBDC</highlight> — Central Bank Digital Currency.",
    "token_lesson5_paragraph2": "<highlight>CBDC</highlight> is a digital version of fiat currency. But it’s not just a digital dollar or euro — it’s a new platform for control and surveillance.",
    "token_lesson5_paragraph3": "Unlike Bitcoin or USDT, a CBDC is issued by a centralized authority — the central bank. Your transactions aren’t just recorded — they’re <highlight>monitored</highlight>.",
    "token_lesson5_paragraph4": "💡 Analogy:\nIf crypto is digital cash, CBDC is a debit card on steroids — with no way to “go offline and disappear”.",
    "token_lesson5_paragraph5": "✅ CBDC benefits (on paper):\n— Instant payments without intermediaries\n— Reduced corruption\n— Better monetary policy\n— Easier international settlements",
    "token_lesson5_paragraph6": "⚠️ Real risks:\n— All transactions are permanently tracked\n— Central bank can freeze your wallet\n— Programmable money: can’t spend on certain things\n— Complete <highlight>centralization</highlight>",
    "token_lesson5_paragraph7": "🧠 <highlight>Philosophy</highlight>:\nCBDC isn’t just currency — it’s a tool of digital governance.\nYou can be “rewarded” for good behavior… or restricted for “wrong” actions.",
    "token_lesson5_paragraph8": "Example:\nIn China, the digital yuan is already used with a social credit system.\nBought too much alcohol? Your spending is limited.\nLiked a political post? Minus points.",
    "token_lesson5_paragraph9": "💥 Realization:\n<highlight>CBDC = total transparency + programmable money + system dependency.</highlight>\nIt’s not really money — it’s a digital token inside a government app.",
    "token_lesson5_paragraph10": "🧭 Conclusion:\nCBDC isn’t about convenience. It’s about power.\nAnd you must understand: <highlight>freedom isn’t the ability to pay easily — it’s the ability to pay freely.</highlight>",
  
    "token_lesson6_title": "Lesson 6: CBDC vs Crypto — Control vs Freedom",
    "token_lesson6_paragraph1": "At first glance they seem similar: both CBDC and crypto have wallets, transactions, and blockchain. But in essence — they follow opposite philosophies.",
    "token_lesson6_paragraph2": "<highlight>CBDC</highlight> — centralized, controlled by the government, your balance is just an entry in a state database.\n<highlight>Crypto</highlight> — decentralized, your wallet is yours, and no one can block it without your signature.",
    "token_lesson6_paragraph3": "💥 Core difference:\n— Crypto creates freedom: you control your money, no one interferes.\n— CBDC creates control: your actions are tracked, limited, canceled.",
    "token_lesson6_paragraph4": "💡 Analogy:\nCrypto = cash in your pocket.\nCBDC = a card under surveillance, with freeze switches.",
    "token_lesson6_paragraph5": "🔐 Crypto protects:\n— anonymity rights\n— freedom of transfers\n— independence from central power\n— autonomy as a human",
    "token_lesson6_paragraph6": "🛑 CBDC restricts:\n— all transactions are visible to the state\n— spending limits possible\n— users can be “disabled”\n— your data can be used against you",
    "token_lesson6_paragraph7": "🧠 <highlight>Philosophy</highlight>:\nCBDC is a system where <highlight>you don’t own the money — you rent numbers</highlight>.\nCrypto is a world where <highlight>money = your digital freedom</highlight>.",
    "token_lesson6_paragraph8": "In one world, you own your capital.\nIn the other — you’re a subject of a digital monarchy, where money works “if you behave well”.\nAnd you don’t define what “well” means.",
    "token_lesson6_paragraph9": "💬 Examples:\n— Crypto: send Bitcoin to a friend abroad — no permission needed.\n— CBDC: to send money abroad — follow rules, limits, purposes. Or get denied.",
    "token_lesson6_paragraph10": "🧭 Conclusion:\n<highlight>CBDC and crypto aren’t competitors — they are opposites in spirit.</highlight>\nOne builds a system of control. The other — a space of freedom.\nThe choice exists. But it must be conscious.",
  
    "token_lesson7_title": "Lesson 7: Where Is CBDC Already Being Used?",

    "token_lesson8_title": "Lesson 8: Tokenization Risks — Where’s the Trap?",
