    "zk_lesson1_paragraph2": "ZK (zero knowledge) is a <highlight>cryptographic way of proving</highlight> something ‚Äî you prove you know something (or did something) without revealing any details.",
    "zk_lesson1_paragraph3": "Simple example: you found a secret exit from a maze. You want to prove this to a friend without showing the path. You enter the maze and come out the other side. Your friend is convinced you know the way ‚Äî but never saw it. That‚Äôs a <highlight>zero-knowledge proof</highlight>.",
    "zk_lesson1_paragraph4": "Such proofs can be used in blockchain: you can prove you have funds without showing your account. Or that you voted ‚Äî without revealing who for.",
    "zk_lesson1_paragraph5": "ZK is the <highlight>future of privacy and security in Web3</highlight>. It's the foundation for DeFi, DAOs, voting, digital identity, and anonymous transactions. No disclosure ‚Äî but full proof.",
  
    "zk_lesson2_title": "Lesson 2: Why ZK matters ‚Äî in life and Web3",
    "zk_lesson2_paragraph1": "Imagine a world where you must reveal all your personal information just to enter a building or send a payment. That‚Äôs the Web2 reality: constant data collection, surveillance, and centralization.",
    "zk_lesson2_paragraph2": "ZK solves this. It lets you <highlight>prove something without revealing anything unnecessary</highlight>. You prove a fact, but don't share the details. It's like saying \"I know the password\" without naming it.",
    "zk_lesson2_paragraph3": "In Web3, ZK is used for anonymous transactions, identity verification without exposure, DAO voting, and even in DeFi ‚Äî where you don‚Äôt want to reveal your balances or strategies.",
    "zk_lesson2_paragraph4": "ZK is needed wherever <highlight>privacy, security, and trust without intermediaries</highlight> matter. It makes the digital world freer ‚Äî without corporate control or data leaks.",
    "zk_lesson2_paragraph5": "ZK is what helps build a truly decentralized internet ‚Äî where each person controls their own information, without handing it over to governments or tech giants.",
  
    "zk_lesson3_title": "Lesson 3: ZK in real life ‚Äî examples anyone can understand",
    "zk_lesson3_paragraph1": "You don‚Äôt need to be a cryptographer to understand ZK. It‚Äôs already around us in real life. For example: <highlight>you want to prove you have money without saying how much</highlight>. You just show you can buy something ‚Äî and that's it. That‚Äôs a ZK-style example.",
    "zk_lesson3_paragraph2": "Another example: you know a secret route out of a maze. Instead of showing the path, you go in and come out the other side. Your friend sees it ‚Äî and believes you know the way. But he never saw the path. That‚Äôs a <highlight>zero-knowledge proof</highlight>.",
    "zk_lesson3_paragraph3": "Or let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre playing a game where you find treasure. You want to prove you found it, but don‚Äôt want to share the coordinates. You send proof via a code (signature) ‚Äî everyone sees you‚Äôre right, but no one knows where it is.",
    "zk_lesson3_paragraph4": "These examples show the idea: <highlight>ZK is a way to prove that you know or can do something</highlight>, without revealing the actual info.",
    "zk_lesson3_paragraph5": "The more analogies like this you know, the easier it is to understand future tech. Don‚Äôt fear words like 'cryptography' or 'proofs' ‚Äî in practice, it‚Äôs all much simpler than it first seems.",

    "zk_lesson4_title": "Lesson 4: ZK vs Encryption ‚Äî what's the difference?",
    "zk_lesson4_paragraph1": "Many people think that <highlight>Zero-Knowledge</highlight> is just a 'new type of encryption'. But that‚Äôs not true. Let‚Äôs break it down.",
    "zk_lesson4_paragraph2": "üì¶ <highlight>Encryption</highlight> hides data. It makes information unreadable without a special key. Example: you encrypt a file, and only someone with the key can decrypt and read it.",
    "zk_lesson4_paragraph3": "üîç <highlight>Zero-Knowledge</highlight> is not about hiding data, but about <highlight>proving</highlight> something. You reveal nothing ‚Äî but prove that you know or own something.",
    "zk_lesson4_paragraph4": "Imagine: encryption is a locked door only the key holder can open. ZK is a way to prove you know what‚Äôs behind the door ‚Äî without opening it. A totally different approach.",
    "zk_lesson4_paragraph5": "Together, they‚Äôre powerful. For example, in projects like <a href=\"https://zksync.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">zkSync</a> or <a href=\"https://aztec.network\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Aztec</a>, both ZK proofs and encryption are used: one for privacy, the other for proving actions without revealing them.",
  
    "zk_lesson5_title": "Lesson 5: How ZK works ‚Äî a simple explanation of the mechanics",
    "zk_lesson5_paragraph1": "Ok, you got it: ZK lets you prove a fact without revealing the details. But how does it work under the hood? Let‚Äôs simplify it.",
    "zk_lesson5_paragraph2": "üí° At the core of ZK is a <highlight>protocol</highlight> between two sides: the <highlight>prover</highlight> and the <highlight>verifier</highlight>. One proves ‚Äî the other checks. But without revealing the actual info.",
    "zk_lesson5_paragraph3": "üîÅ Classic ZK protocols use repeated checks. For example: you claim to know a maze path. The verifier randomly picks the entrance or exit, and you repeatedly show you can appear at the right spot. After 20 tries, it‚Äôs almost impossible you're just guessing.",
    "zk_lesson5_paragraph4": "üì¶ In modern systems, it's all converted into math ‚Äî so-called <highlight>zk-SNARKs</highlight> or <highlight>zk-STARKs</highlight>. They compress all logic into a short proof that‚Äôs easy to verify.",
    "zk_lesson5_paragraph5": "For example, on <a href=\"https://zksync.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">zkSync</a>, every action inside the network can be aggregated and verified via a single ZK proof. This gives both scalability and privacy.",
    "zk_lesson5_paragraph6": "The core idea of ZK is that <highlight>verification becomes fast, and disclosure becomes optional</highlight>. You gain trust ‚Äî without leaking info. That‚Äôs what makes this technology a foundation for the future of Web3.",
  
    "zk_lesson6_title": "Lesson 6: ZK and hashes ‚Äî one-way knowledge magic",
    "zk_lesson6_paragraph1": "ZK proofs often use <highlight>hash functions</highlight> ‚Äî mathematical transformations that turn any text or data into a fixed-length encrypted fingerprint.",
    "zk_lesson6_paragraph2": "For example, the word 'password123' becomes something like <highlight>5e8848...c3b5</highlight>. That‚Äôs a hash. And it‚Äôs impossible (or nearly) to reverse it and get the original input.",
    "zk_lesson6_paragraph3": "Now the key idea: <highlight>if you can prove you know the value that generated a given hash</highlight> ‚Äî that‚Äôs already powerful. And you don‚Äôt have to name the value.",
    "zk_lesson6_paragraph4": "This idea powers many ZK protocols. For example, in <a href=\"https://semaphore.appliedzkp.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Semaphore</a>, the hash acts like an 'anonymous voice'. You publish proof you‚Äôre allowed to vote, but no one knows who you are.",
    "zk_lesson6_paragraph5": "A hash is like a lock you can close, but not reopen. And if you can show you have the key ‚Äî that‚Äôs enough to earn trust. That‚Äôs how Zero-Knowledge is built.",

    "zk_lesson7_title": "Lesson 7: ZK-SNARKs ‚Äî compressed proofs that are easy to verify",
    "zk_lesson7_paragraph1": "ZK-SNARK is one of the most popular proof types in Zero-Knowledge. The name sounds complex, but the idea is simple: <highlight>SNARK</highlight> = <highlight>Succinct Non-interactive Argument of Knowledge</highlight>. Basically ‚Äî a short, non-interactive proof that you know something without revealing it.",
    "zk_lesson7_paragraph2": "The main feature of SNARK is <highlight>compactness and speed</highlight>. The proof takes little space and can be quickly verified ‚Äî no matter how complex the operation is.",
    "zk_lesson7_paragraph3": "This method is used in real blockchains. For example, <a href=\"https://z.cash\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Zcash</a> uses SNARK for anonymous transactions. No one sees the sender, receiver, or amount ‚Äî but the network confirms everything is valid.",
    "zk_lesson7_paragraph4": "In <a href=\"https://polygon.technology/solutions/polygon-zkevm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Polygon zkEVM</a>, ZK-SNARK is used to scale Ethereum. It combines thousands of operations into one proof that validators can quickly check on the mainnet.",
    "zk_lesson7_paragraph5": "SNARKs are great, but they have a downside: <highlight>trusted setup</highlight>. During system creation, special parameters must be generated ‚Äî and if someone saves them, it could harm security. We‚Äôll discuss this more in future lessons.",
  
    "zk_lesson8_title": "Lesson 8: ZK-STARKs ‚Äî transparent alternative without 'magic'",
    "zk_lesson8_paragraph1": "ZK-STARK is a modern alternative to SNARK that doesn‚Äôt require a trusted setup. The name means <highlight>Scalable Transparent Argument of Knowledge</highlight>. Its main benefits: <highlight>scalability</highlight> and <highlight>transparency</highlight>.",
    "zk_lesson8_paragraph2": "The key difference from SNARK: STARK doesn‚Äôt need a ‚Äòtrusted setup‚Äô ‚Äî secret parameters that could be stolen. Everything is created transparently, with no hidden elements.",
    "zk_lesson8_paragraph3": "STARK also scales better: it can handle large amounts of data and computation. However, its proofs are usually <highlight>larger in size</highlight> and take longer to verify.",
    "zk_lesson8_paragraph4": "One of the main STARK users is <a href=\"https://starknet.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">StarkNet</a>, a ZK-rollup for Ethereum built by <a href=\"https://starkware.co\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">StarkWare</a>. It uses its own language, Cairo, specifically made to generate STARK proofs.",
    "zk_lesson8_paragraph5": "To sum up: SNARKs are compact and fast but need a 'magical' setup. STARKs are transparent and scalable but heavier. Both are widely used ‚Äî and both move Web3 toward privacy and trust.",
  
    "zk_lesson9_title": "Lesson 9: ZK-based Rollups ‚Äî zkRollup vs Optimistic Rollup",
    "zk_lesson9_paragraph1": "A Rollup is a way to <highlight>scale Ethereum</highlight> by moving computations off the main network (L1) while keeping its security. There are two main types: <highlight>zkRollup</highlight> and <highlight>Optimistic Rollup</highlight>.",
    "zk_lesson9_paragraph2": "üîç <highlight>zkRollup</highlight> uses Zero-Knowledge proofs. It bundles thousands of transactions into one and only posts the proof of correctness. It‚Äôs fast, secure, and efficient. Examples: <a href=\"https://zksync.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">zkSync</a>, <a href=\"https://starknet.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">StarkNet</a>, <a href=\"https://polygon.technology/solutions/polygon-zkevm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Polygon zkEVM</a>.",
    "zk_lesson9_paragraph3": "ü§î <highlight>Optimistic Rollup</highlight> works differently. It assumes all transactions are honest ‚Äî unless challenged. Verification only happens if someone raises a ‚Äòchallenge‚Äô. This approach is simpler, but slower (because of the waiting period). Examples: <a href=\"https://arbitrum.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Arbitrum</a>, <a href=\"https://optimism.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Optimism</a>.",
    "zk_lesson9_paragraph4": "Main benefits of zkRollup: <highlight>no delays, high privacy, mathematical accuracy</highlight>. But they are technically more complex and take longer to develop.",
    "zk_lesson9_paragraph5": "Both approaches are used today, but more projects are moving toward ZK-based solutions. Because the future of Web3 is speed, privacy, and cryptographic truth. And zkRollup delivers it.",
  
    "zk_lesson10_title": "Lesson 10: zkEVM and zkVM ‚Äî why they matter and what‚Äôs the difference",
    "zk_lesson10_paragraph1": "If you‚Äôve heard terms like <highlight>zkEVM</highlight>, <highlight>zkVM</highlight>, <highlight>Cairo</highlight>, <highlight>LLVM</highlight> ‚Äî don‚Äôt worry. These are just different ways to use Zero-Knowledge inside smart contracts and apps.",
    "zk_lesson10_paragraph2": "<highlight>zkEVM</highlight> is a Zero-Knowledge version of the Ethereum Virtual Machine.

    "zk_lesson10_paragraph4": "The difference: zkEVM = maximum Ethereum compatibility, easy for developers. zkVM = more flexible, but may require new languages and architecture. Both aim to combine privacy and scalability.",
